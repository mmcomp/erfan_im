<p>Stem cells are proliferative cells having self-renewal ability. Because of their promising regenerative potential, these cells have been applied to treat number of diseases. According to the US clinical trials registry database (www.clinicaltrials.gov), near about 30,000 clinical studies regarding cell therapy has been registered and stem cells account for 5000 studies. A multitude of factors have been studied carefully like cell homing, viability, engraftment, safety profile, cellular delivery time and retention (<a href="#_ENREF_3">3</a>). Poor survival, very low homing, possible teratogenic effect, massive apoptosis of transplanted cells, low cellular retention and viability have questioned the effectiveness of stem cell therapy and controversies flawing its clinical potential are in discussion .</p>

<p>In spite of having such type of limitations, stem cell therapy has gain a monumental advances for a number of clinical problems like cardiac regeneration (<a href="#_ENREF_48">Le Huu<em> et al.</em>, 2012</a>). Stem cell-based cardiac regeneration is under studies for a wide range of diseases such as acute and chronic ischemic myocardial damage, cardiomyopathy, etc.</p>

<p>Technical developments in last decades to solve cellular transplantation problems have been seen and cells are engineered or modified for enhanced grafting and improved regeneration (<a href="#_ENREF_81">Pendyala<em> et al.</em>, 2008</a>). Cellular engineering or modifications have gained considerable attention and scientists could developed techniques for enhanced pluripotent behavior, increased stem cell homing and retention etc (<a href="#_ENREF_96">Ruvinov<em> et al.</em>, 2012</a>).</p>

<p><strong>2. Cardiovascular Problems and Treatments</strong></p>

<p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the causing 30% global deaths every year. So far, 17 million cases of coronary heart diseases are being registered in United States only, out of which 5.3 have lost their cardiac functions (<a href="#_ENREF_56">Loughran<em> et al.</em>, 2013</a>). The most common cause of cardiac failure is ischemic heart in which oxygen supply is limited and depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) happens. This cardiac failure occurs in three major steps i) coronary occlusion, 2) angina pectoris and 3) coagulative necrosis (<a href="#_ENREF_96">Soonpaa<em> et al.</em>, 1994</a>).</p>

<p>CVDs consist of group of diseases that have been shown in Figure 1. This figure also demonstrate US prevalence<strong> </strong>of<strong> </strong>each categories.</p>
